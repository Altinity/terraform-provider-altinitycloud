# altinitycloud_env_hcloud_status (Data Source)

Altinity.Cloud HCloud environment status data source. It will long pool the status until `matching_spec` is `true`. Use this data source to wait for the environment is fully provisioned.

## Example Usage

### Read HCloud environment status:
```terraform
data "altinitycloud_env_hcloud_status" "current" {
  name = "acme-staging"
}
```

### Wait for HCloud environment to be fully provisioned:
```terraform
resource "altinitycloud_env_hcloud" "this" {
  name             = "acme-staging"
  cidr             = "10.136.0.0/21"
  network_zone     = "us-west"
  locations        = ["hil"]
  hcloud_token_enc = "encrypted-token"
  force_destroy    = true

  load_balancers = {
    public = {
      enabled          = true
      source_ip_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    }
  }

  node_groups = [{
    capacity_per_location = 10
    name                  = "cpx11"
    node_type             = "cpx11"
    reservations          = ["CLICKHOUSE", "SYSTEM", "ZOOKEEPER"]
    locations             = ["hil"]
  }]
}


data "altinitycloud_env_hcloud_status" "current" {
  name                           = altinitycloud_env_gcp.this.name
  wait_for_applied_spec_revision = altinitycloud_env_gcp.this.spec_revision
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) A globally-unique environment identifier. **[IMMUTABLE]**

		- All environment names must start with your account name as prefix.
		- ⚠️ Changing environment name after creation will force a resource replacement.

		Examples:
		- "acme-staging" (where "acme" is your account name)

### Optional

- `wait_for_applied_spec_revision` (Number) Use this attribute to wait for the environment to be fully provisioned. It will long pull environment status until it matches the applied spec revision.

### Read-Only

- `applied_spec_revision` (Number) Applied spec revision
- `id` (String) ID of the environment (automatically generated based on the name)
- `pending_delete` (Boolean) `true` indicates that environment is pending deletion
