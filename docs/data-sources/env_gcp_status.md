# altinitycloud_env_gcp_status (Data Source)

Altinity.Cloud GCP environment status data source. It will long pool the status until `matching_spec` is `true`. Use this data source to wait for the environment is fully provisioned.

## Example Usage

### Read GCP environment status:
```terraform
data "altinitycloud_env_gcp_status" "current" {
  name = "acme-staging"
}
```

### Wait for GCP environment to be fully provisioned:
```terraform
resource "altinitycloud_env_gcp" "this" {
  name           = "acme-staging"
  gcp_project_id = "gcp-project-id"
  region         = "us-east1"
  zones          = ["us-east1-b", "us-east1-d"]
  cidr           = "10.67.0.0/21"

  node_groups = [
    {
      node_type         = "e2-standard-2"
      capacity_per_zone = 10
      reservations      = ["SYSTEM", "ZOOKEEPER"]
    },
    {
      node_type         = "n2d-standard-2"
      capacity_per_zone = 10
      reservations      = ["CLICKHOUSE"]
    }
  ]
}


data "altinitycloud_env_gcp_status" "current" {
  name                           = altinitycloud_env_gcp.this.name
  wait_for_applied_spec_revision = altinitycloud_env_gcp.this.spec_revision
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) A globally-unique environment identifier. **[IMMUTABLE]**

		- All environment names must start with your account name as prefix.
		- ⚠️ Changing environment name after creation will force a resource replacement.

		Examples:
		- "acme-staging" (where "acme" is your account name)

### Optional

- `wait_for_applied_spec_revision` (Number) Use this attribute to wait for the environment to be fully provisioned. It will long pull environment status until it matches the applied spec revision.

### Read-Only

- `applied_spec_revision` (Number) Applied spec revision
- `id` (String) ID of the environment (automatically generated based on the name)
- `pending_delete` (Boolean) `true` indicates that environment is pending deletion
