# altinitycloud_env_k8s_status (Data Source)

Altinity.Cloud K8S environment status data source. It will long pool the status until `matching_spec` is `true`. Use this data source to wait for the environment is fully provisioned.

## Example Usage

### Read K8S environment status:
```terraform
data "altinitycloud_env_k8s_status" "current" {
  name = "acme-staging"
}
```

### Wait for K8S environment to be fully provisioned:
```terraform
resource "altinitycloud_env_k8s" "this" {
  name         = "acme-staging"
  distribution = "EKS"

  node_groups = [
    {
      node_type         = "t4g.large"
      capacity_per_zone = 10
      reservations      = ["SYSTEM", "ZOOKEEPER"]
    },
    {
      node_type         = "m6i.large"
      capacity_per_zone = 10
      reservations      = ["CLICKHOUSE"]
    }
  ]
}

data "altinitycloud_env_k8s_status" "current" {
  name                           = altinitycloud_env_k8s.this.name
  wait_for_applied_spec_revision = altinitycloud_env_k8s.this.spec_revision
}
```
