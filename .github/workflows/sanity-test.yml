name: Sanity Tests

# Triggers terraform sanity tests in the cloud-regression repo and
# waits for them to finish, mirroring the result (pass/fail/cancelled).
#
# Sanity tests also run as a gate in release.yml (before publishing a release);
# this workflow is for manual runs and for post-release verification.
#
# Requires a CLOUD_REGRESSION_PAT secret: a GitHub PAT (or fine-grained token)
# with "actions:write" permission on the Altinity/cloud-regression repository.
